# Rubik's cube solver using OpenCV and Python

This repository contains a set of algorithms and libraries to solve the Rubik's cube with a camera and a raspberry pi. 
    

## Computer vision

The goal of this step is to read the current state of the cube and move from it towards a solution. 

## Solver

Given the current state, the solver will compute a solution.
