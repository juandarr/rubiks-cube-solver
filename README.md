# Rubik's cube solver using OpenCV and Python

This repository contains a set of algorithms and libraries to solve the Rubik's cube with a camera and a raspberry pi. 
    

## Cube description

Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974[1][2] by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ern≈ë Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube,[3] the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp. in 1980[4] via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer,[5] and won the German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle that year. As of January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide[6][7] making it the world's top-selling puzzle game.[8][9] It is widely considered to be the world's best-selling toy.[
    
## Computer vision

The goal of this step is to read the current state of the cube and move from it towards a solution. 

## Solver

Given the current state, the solver will compute a solution.
