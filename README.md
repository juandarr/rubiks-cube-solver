# Rubik's cube solver using OpenCV and Python

This repository contains a set of algorithms and libraries to solve the Rubik's cube with a camera and computer vision.
    

## Cube description

Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ern≈ë Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp. in 1980 via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and won the German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle that year. 450 million cubes had been sold worldwide to date, making it the world's top-selling puzzle game. It is widely considered to be the world's best-selling toy.

The rubik's cube is also a highly versatile educational tool and can be used to introduce people of all ages to computer science, algorithms and math. Erno Rubik wanted the cube to help children think in 3 Dimensional. At the end, it has become the fascination of countless individuals from all background who have devoted time to solve and understand this magical creation.

# Repository estructure and goals

There are several steps involved in the creation of a pipeline to solve the rubik's cube. In this section each step is described in detail.

## Knowledge representation


## Computer vision

The goal of this step is to read the current state of the cube and move from it towards a solution. 

## Solver

Given the current state, the solver will compute a solution.
